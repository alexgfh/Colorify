Before delivery:
1. Make color and threshold editable once picture is taken.
2. Make previously taken pictures editable (new mode, new activity, etc, practically another app on UI's perspective).
3. Make resulting picture saveable and shareable [Add hashtag/watermark].
4. Make Hue selectable, [either by picking color on hue bitmap itself or through click position].
10h*4 => 40 hours total

Extras in order of priority: [Remember to do all of these on Processing/glslsandbox, never android first]

1: (better picture)
Filter resulting image to remove noise.
Custom filter: Multi-pass that considers hue information. (not blur, just adds fragment to segmented set)
3x3 kernel -> 'if in hue_threshold, add it to colored set' Many passes [reducing threshold with each pass]
Consider doing this only on captured frame.

2: (better UI)
Automatically select color and threshold according to pixel vicinity.
e.g.: color is 5x5 closest-9 gaussian mean, threshold is variance of 5x5 block.
Consider doing this only on captured Frame.

3: (Easy one)
Add features to the desature all colors but one filter
e.g.: set saturation to (1.0-hue_difference), hue_difference in [0,1]
e.g.: desaturate more than one color
e.g.: desaturate regions of the image, each according to a color

3: (Broad)
New filters [focus on augmented reality + photography]
Consider android.hardware.camera2 for API 21+

4: iOS
